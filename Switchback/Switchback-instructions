The game is based off of Binary Art's Switchback.
See <http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1736>
There are 8 sliders that have 4 open spots to hold marbles.
Each slider has two possible slide positions, and the positions of each slider alternates.
That is, if all sliders are pushed to the left, the resulting marbles and open spaces would form a checkerboard pattern.
To allo you to move multiple sliders at once wihtout gravity affecting you, you can apply gravity only when you want to.



Instructions:
w/s to apply gravity, either up or down.
Mouse to click on a slider to move it to the opposite position.

Goal:
Create patterns.
The original Switchback has a booklet of patterns to reach, so really, try to reach any pattern you fancy.
Given the duplicity of the marbles, any pattern is (most likely) reachable. If you can think of, you can probably get there.
